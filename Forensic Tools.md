# 🔍 Accessing Blockchain Forensics Without Chainalysis or CipherTrace Credentials

You don’t need to be law enforcement or a financial institution to conduct deep blockchain investigations.  
This guide shows how to **simulate pro-grade forensic workflows using publicly accessible tools.**

## 🛠️ 2. How to Set Up & Use Public Blockchain Forensic Tools

---

### 🛰️ A. Etherscan – Monitor Suspicious Wallets

**Steps:**

1. Go to [Etherscan.io](https://etherscan.io)
2. Enter the attacker’s wallet address
3. Review recent transactions
4. Check for Tornado Cash or CEX activity
5. Use **“View Token Transfers”** to monitor ERC-20 movement

✅ Great for real-time manual tracking.

---

### 🧪 B. Tenderly – Simulate Attacks & Trace Interactions

**Steps:**

1. Go to [Tenderly.co](https://tenderly.co)
2. Select **"Simulate Transaction"**
3. Paste a function call like `withdraw()` or `transfer()`
4. Simulate different scenarios (e.g., reentrancy attack)
5. Review execution trace and fund flows

✅ Helps you model exploits in a controlled environment.

### 📡 C. Forta – Real-Time Smart Contract Monitoring

Install CLI:

```bash
npm install -g forta-agent
forta init
```

Create a bot:

```js
const { Finding, HandleTransaction } = require("forta-agent");

const HIGH_WITHDRAWAL_THRESHOLD = 10 * 10 ** 18; // 10 ETH

function handleTransaction(txEvent) {
  const findings = [];
  txEvent.traces.forEach((trace) => {
    if (trace.action.value > HIGH_WITHDRAWAL_THRESHOLD) {
      findings.push(
        Finding.fromObject({
          name: "Large Withdrawal Detected",
          description: `A withdrawal of ${trace.action.value} ETH was detected`,
          alertId: "FORTA-1",
          severity: Finding.Severity.Medium,
        })
      );
    }
  });
  return findings;
}

module.exports = { handleTransaction };
```

Deploy it:

```bash
forta publish
```

✅ Forta will now detect and report large ETH withdrawals.

### 🌐 D. MistTrack – Stolen Fund Movement via Exchanges

**Steps:**

1. Visit [MistTrack.io](https://misttrack.io)
2. Input attacker’s address
3. View destination exchanges
4. Submit evidence to CEXs (e.g., Binance, Coinbase)

✅ Strong option for post-exploit reporting.

---

### 🧭 E. Breadcrumbs – Visualize On-Chain Wallet Movement

**Steps:**

1. Visit [Breadcrumbs.app](https://breadcrumbs.app)
2. Paste an address
3. Click “Generate Graph”
4. Follow wallet flows visually

✅ Great for storytelling, reports, and court/IR documentation.

## 📌 3. Can You Still Access Chainalysis or CipherTrace?

Yes, but it requires specific conditions:

| Method                                     | How It Works                                                    | Success Rate |
| ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| **University Program**                     | Enroll in a blockchain security course using Chainalysis        | ✅ High      |
| **Work for a Cybersecurity Firm**          | Join firms like Halborn, Certik, TRM Labs that have full access | ✅ Very High |
| **Apply for Independent Research License** | Request access for white-hat or academic analysis               | ⚠️ Moderate  |
| **Work at a Crypto Exchange**              | Exchanges like Coinbase use enterprise forensic tools           | ✅ Very High |
| **Law Enforcement Sponsorship**            | Collaborate with investigators on active cases                  | ⚠️ Difficult |

## 🚀 Summary: What You Can Do Without Chainalysis

| Forensic Task                  | Public Tool             | Enterprise Tool             |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Track stolen funds manually    | Etherscan, MistTrack    | Chainalysis KYT             |
| Detect smart contract exploits | Forta                   | CipherTrace Defender        |
| Visualize fund movement        | Breadcrumbs.app         | Chainalysis Reactor         |
| On-chain wallet activity       | Dune Analytics          | CipherTrace Armada          |
| Simulate pre-exploit attacks   | Tenderly Sandbox        | Elliptic Forensics          |
| Freeze funds at exchanges      | Submit CEX abuse report | Chainalysis + exchange APIs |

✅ These tools provide more than enough power to perform **deep forensic investigations**, even without institutional access.
